# TeX-LuaCATS

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

LuaCATS stands for "Lua Comment And Type System", which is the system used 
by the [Sumneko](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server) or 
the [EmmyLua](https://github.com/EmmyLuaLs/emmylua-analyzer-rust) language server.

This group is inspired by the [LuaCATS](https://github.com/LuaCATS) Github organisation.
